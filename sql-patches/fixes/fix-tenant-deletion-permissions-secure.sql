-- =============================================================================
-- Usage Instructions
-- =============================================================================

-- To delete a tenant securely, run:
-- SELECT delete_tenant_secure('your-tenant-id-here');

-- This function will:
-- 1. Verify you are a super admin
-- 2. Cascade delete all related data in proper order
-- 3. Maintain full audit trail through logging
-- 4. Ensure transactional safety
-- 5. Respect all foreign key constraints
