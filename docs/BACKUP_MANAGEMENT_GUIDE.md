## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### Disaster Recovery
1. **Assess Situation**: Determine data loss scope
2. **Locate Backups**: Identify most recent valid backup
3. **Verify Integrity**: Check backup checksums
4. **Restore Planning**: Plan restoration procedure
5. **Execute Restore**: Implement restoration (with extreme caution)

### Data Corruption
