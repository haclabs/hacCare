# Microsoft Office 365 Sign-In Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. **Updated Login Form** (`src/components/Auth/LoginForm.tsx`)
   - Added Microsoft sign-in button with official Microsoft logo
   - Implemented `handleMicrosoftSignIn()` function using Supabase OAuth
   - Added loading states for OAuth flow
   - Added visual divider between email/password and OAuth sign-in
   - Disabled both buttons during OAuth process to prevent conflicts

### 2. **Created OAuth Callback Handler** (`src/components/Auth/AuthCallback.tsx`)
   - Handles the redirect from Microsoft OAuth
   - Processes the session from URL parameters
   - Shows loading spinner during processing
   - Redirects to home page on success or login page on error
   - Error handling with descriptive error codes

### 3. **Added Callback Route** (`src/App.tsx`)
   - Added `/auth/callback` route to handle OAuth redirects
   - Route is accessible without authentication
   - Positioned before protected routes

### 4. **Created Setup Documentation** (`docs/MICROSOFT_OAUTH_SETUP.md`)
   - Complete step-by-step guide for Azure AD setup
   - Supabase configuration instructions
   - Troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Security considerations and best practices
   - Production deployment checklist

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign in with Microsoft" button on login page
2. User is redirected to Microsoft's login page
3. User authenticates with Office 365 credentials
4. Microsoft redirects back to `/auth/callback` with auth tokens
5. Callback handler processes the session
6. User is redirected to home page with active session

### Technical Flow:
```
LoginForm → supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth()
           ↓
Microsoft Login Page
           ↓
/auth/callback → AuthCallback component
           ↓
supabase.auth.getSession()
           ↓
AuthContext (manages user state)
           ↓
Home Page
```

## Setup Required

### In Azure Portal:
1. Register application in Azure AD
2. Configure redirect URI: `https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
3. Create client secret
4. Configure API permissions (email, openid, profile, User.Read)
5. Grant admin consent

### In Supabase:
1. Enable Azure OAuth provider
2. Add Azure Client ID, Secret, and Tenant ID
3. Configure redirect URLs for your domains

### In Your App:
✅ Already done - code is ready to use!

## Testing Checklist

Before using in production:

- [ ] Azure AD application registered
- [ ] Client ID and secret added to Supabase
- [ ] Redirect URLs configured for your domain
- [ ] Test login with Microsoft account
- [ ] Verify user profile is created
- [ ] Test error handling (wrong credentials, denied permissions)
- [ ] Test on production domain
- [ ] Verify session persistence

## Next Steps

1. **Follow the setup guide** in `docs/MICROSOFT_OAUTH_SETUP.md`
2. **Register your app** in Azure Portal
3. **Configure Supabase** with Azure credentials
4. **Test the integration** in development
5. **Deploy to production** after testing

## Support

For setup help, refer to:
- `docs/MICROSOFT_OAUTH_SETUP.md` - Full setup guide
- Azure AD documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/
- Supabase OAuth docs: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login

## Notes

- OAuth flow requires HTTPS in production (http://localhost works for dev)
- Microsoft requires organization approval for production use
- Client secrets expire and need rotation
- First-time users will need their profile set up in HacCare (may need admin intervention)
