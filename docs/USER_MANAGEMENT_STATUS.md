# User Management Issue Resolution Summary

## Latest Update (July 24, 2025)
üéâ **NEW FIX**: Added status filter functionality to view inactive users
- **Issue**: Users were not visible because they were marked as inactive
- **Solution**: Removed active-only filter and added status dropdown ("All Users", "Active Users", "Inactive Users")
- **UI Improvements**: Enhanced visual distinction for inactive users with grayed-out styling

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Fixed Issues:**
- UserForm useAuth import error 
- Tenant assignment feature for super admins implemented
- RLS policy infinite recursion resolved with helper view
- Data type mismatches fixed (JSONB ‚Üí TEXT[])
- Created safe RPC functions for tenant queries

‚ùå **Remaining Issues:**
- Users cannot be deleted due to Auth API limitations
- Role constraint violations when assigning existing users to tenants
- Super admin users incorrectly placed in tenant_users table

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **User Deletion Issue**: Supabase Auth API requires service role key to delete users, which frontend doesn't have access to
2. **Role Constraint Violation**: The `tenant_users` table only allows roles `('admin', 'doctor', 'nurse', 'viewer')` but some users have other roles like `'super_admin'`
3. **Architecture Issue**: Super admin users should NOT be in the `tenant_users` table - they manage globally across all tenants

## Solution Approach

### 1. Soft Delete Instead of Hard Delete
- Replace user deletion with user deactivation
- Set `is_active = false` in both `user_profiles` and `tenant_users` tables
- Filter out inactive users in the UI

### 2. Fix Role Constraint Issues
- Remove super admin users from `tenant_users` table (they shouldn't be there)
- Fix any users with invalid roles
- Clean up orphaned user assignments

### 3. Database Functions Created
- `deactivate_user(UUID)` - Soft delete users (super admin only)
- `permanently_delete_user(UUID)` - Hard delete from database tables (super admin only)
- `cleanup_orphaned_users()` - Find users without tenant assignments
- `fix_user_role_mismatches()` - Fix role constraint violations

## Files Updated

### Frontend Changes
- ‚úÖ `src/components/Users/UserManagement.tsx` - Changed to use deactivation instead of deletion
- ‚úÖ `src/components/Users/UserForm.tsx` - Added tenant assignment for super admins

### Database Scripts
- ‚úÖ `fix-user-deletion-and-roles-updated.sql` - Complete solution for user management issues

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Apply Database Fixes
Run the SQL script `fix-user-deletion-and-roles-updated.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- This script will:
-- - Fix role constraints on tenant_users table
-- - Create deactivation functions
-- - Remove super admins from tenant_users table
-- - Clean up orphaned users
-- - Show current issues that need attention
```

### 2. Test the Solution
After applying the SQL script:
1. Try the "Delete" button in User Management (now deactivates users)
2. Test tenant assignment for existing users
3. Verify super admins can manage all tenants without constraint errors

### 3. Verify Results
The script will show:
- Users that were removed from tenant_users table
- Any role mismatches that were fixed
- Orphaned users that need attention

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema Clarification
- `user_profiles` table: Contains all users with global roles
- `tenant_users` table: Contains tenant-specific role assignments (NOT for super admins)
- Super admins manage globally and should not have entries in `tenant_users`

### Error Messages You Were Seeing
- "User not allowed" - Supabase Auth API limitation requiring service role
- Role constraint violations - Super admins in tenant_users table where they shouldn't be

### UI Changes Made
- Delete button now shows "deactivate" and uses soft delete
- Only active users are shown in the user list
- Tenant assignment works without constraint violations

## Expected Outcome

After applying the fixes:
1. ‚úÖ User "deletion" will work (via deactivation)
2. ‚úÖ Tenant assignment will work for all valid user roles
3. ‚úÖ Super admins will manage globally without constraint errors
4. ‚úÖ No more infinite recursion in RLS policies
5. ‚úÖ Clean separation between global and tenant-specific user management

The system will have proper multi-tenant user management with soft deletion and appropriate role constraints.
