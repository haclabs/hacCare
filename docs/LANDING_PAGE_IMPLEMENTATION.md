# Landing Page Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created a professional landing page for HacCare that displays when users visit haccare.app without being authenticated. The landing page provides information about the platform and directs users to login or get started.

## Files Created

### 1. `/src/components/LandingPage/LandingPage.tsx`
Main landing page component with:
- **Header Navigation**: Logo, About, Features, Contact, Login, and Get Started buttons
- **Hero Section**: Main heading and call-to-action
- **Feature Cards**: Four key features (Patient-Centered, Realistic Scenarios, Collaborative Learning, Safe Environment)
- **About Section**: Two-column layout explaining the platform purpose and technology
- **Features Section**: Detailed capabilities with additional tools showcase
- **Contact Section**: Contact form with email, phone, location (form submission disabled for now)
- **Footer**: Links and copyright information

### 2. `/src/components/LandingPage/index.ts`
Export file for cleaner imports

### 3. Logo file already exists at:
`/src/components/LandingPage/logo.png`

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/main.tsx`
- Added imports for `LandingPage` and `LoginForm`
- Restructured routing:
  - `/` - Landing page (public)
  - `/login` - Login form (public)
  - `/app/*` - Protected application routes

### 2. `/src/components/Auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- Changed from showing `LoginForm` inline to redirecting to `/login` route
- Added React Router `Navigate` component for redirects

### 3. `/src/components/Auth/LoginForm.tsx`
- Added `useNavigate` and `useEffect` hooks
- Auto-redirects to `/app` after successful login
- Prevents logged-in users from accessing login page

### 4. `/src/contexts/auth/AuthContext.tsx`
- Modified auth state change handler to wait for profile fetch before clearing loading state
- Added automatic profile creation for OAuth users (Microsoft)

## Routing Structure

```
haccare.app/
├── / (Landing Page - Public)
│   ├── Click "Login" → /login
│   ├── Click "Get Started" → /login
│   └── Click "Start Learning Today" → /login
│
├── /login (Login Form - Public)
│   └── After successful login → /app
│
└── /app/* (Protected Routes - Requires Authentication)
    ├── /app/patients
    ├── /app/dashboard
    ├── /app/settings
    └── ... (all existing routes)
```
