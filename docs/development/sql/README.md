**Purpose**: Comprehensive fix for PostgREST schema cache issues and trigger problems

- Creates `create_patient_alert_v3()` RPC function with dynamic SQL to bypass schema cache
- Recreates all triggers on affected tables

**When to use**: 
- Deploy this after any schema changes that add tenant_id columns
- Use when experiencing "column does not exist" errors despite the column existing

**Status**: âœ… DEPLOYED and WORKING (as of October 2025)
