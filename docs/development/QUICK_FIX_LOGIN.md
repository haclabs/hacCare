# Quick Fix Guide - Login Timeout

## Problem
Login takes forever and times out, showing "Profile fetch timeout" and "Tenant still loading"

## Solution - Run These 2 SQL Scripts

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ First: Add Performance Indexes
**File:** `docs/development/sql/add_performance_indexes.sql`

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run this file. It will:
- Add indexes to speed up profile and tenant lookups
- Refresh the materialized view cache
- Update database statistics

**Expected time:** ~30 seconds to run

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second: Optimize RPC Function (Optional)
**File:** `docs/development/sql/optimize_tenant_rpc.sql`

This provides two options for the tenant lookup function:
- **Option A**: Uses materialized view (faster) 
- **Option B**: Direct query (no materialized view dependency)

**Recommended:** Start with Option A since we've already granted access to the materialized view

---

## Code Changes Already Applied

‚úÖ Increased timeouts from 8s to 15s  
‚úÖ Added performance timing logs  
‚úÖ Fixed table names (tenant_users not user_tenants)

## Test After Running SQL

1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Login with your account
3. Check console for:
   - `‚è±Ô∏è Profile fetch took XXXms` (should be <100ms)
   - `üè¢ Tenant fetch took XXXms` (should be <200ms)
4. Should NOT see:
   - ‚ùå Profile fetch timeout
   - üõ°Ô∏è User exists but no profile found

## Expected Results

**Before:** Login timeout, need to refresh  
**After:** Instant login (<500ms total)
