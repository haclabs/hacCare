# 🎓 Simulation Portal - Executive Summary

## What We Built

A dedicated simulation access portal at **`simulation.haccare.app`** that provides intelligent, role-based routing for simulation users.

## The Problem We Solved

**Before:**
- Students had to navigate complex menus to find their simulations
- Instructors spent time directing students to the right place
- No clear entry point for simulation-only users
- Confusion about which simulation to enter

**After:**
- Students are automatically routed to their simulation (if only one)
- Multiple simulations? Clear selection screen
- No simulations? Helpful guidance message
- Instructors get dedicated management dashboard
- Clean, professional entry point at simulation.haccare.app

## Key Features

### 🎯 Smart Auto-Routing
- **One simulation assigned** → Auto-redirects after 1.5 seconds
- **Multiple simulations** → Shows selection grid with details
- **No simulations** → Displays helpful instructions

### 👥 Role-Based Experience
- **Students:** Focused on accessing their assigned simulations
- **Instructors:** Dashboard with quick launch and management tools
- **Admins:** Full control over all simulations

### 🔒 Security-First Design
- Row-Level Security (RLS) ensures users only see their data
- Tenant isolation prevents cross-simulation data access
- Role-based permissions enforce proper access control

### 📱 Modern UX
- Mobile-responsive design
- Loading states and animations
- Clear status indicators
- Intuitive card-based interface

## Technical Architecture

### Components
```
SimulationPortal.tsx     → Main portal with auto-routing logic
SimulationRouter.tsx     → Subdomain detection & routing
SimulationService.ts     → Database query functions
```

### Database
```
getUserSimulationAssignments(userId)
  ↓
Queries: simulation_participants + simulation_active
  ↓
Returns: Active simulations with full details
```

### Security
```
RLS Policies ensure:
- Students see only assigned simulations
- Instructors see simulations they teach
- Admins have full access
- No cross-tenant data leaks
```

### Configuration
```toml
# netlify.toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "https://simulation.haccare.app/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Database
```sql
-- Run once in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: setup_simulation_portal_rls.sql
```
