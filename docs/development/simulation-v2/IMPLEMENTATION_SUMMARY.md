# Simulation Portal - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

A complete simulation portal system accessible at `simulation.haccare.app` that provides intelligent auto-routing for simulation users based on their roles and assignments.

## Components Created

### 1. **SimulationPortal.tsx** ✅
**Location:** `/src/components/Simulation/SimulationPortal.tsx`

**Purpose:** Main portal component with smart routing logic

**Features:**
- Auto-detects user's simulation assignments
- **Single assignment** → Auto-redirects after 1.5 seconds with loading screen
- **Multiple assignments** → Shows selection grid
- **No assignments (student)** → Helpful message with instructions
- **Instructor view** → Dashboard with quick actions (Launch/Manage)
- Real-time assignment loading with error handling
- Responsive card-based UI

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
if (assignments.length === 1) {
  // Auto-redirect to single simulation
  setTimeout(() => navigate(`/simulation/${id}`), 1500);
} else if (assignments.length === 0 && !isInstructor) {
  // Show "no simulations" message
} else {
  // Show selection screen
}
```

### 2. **SimulationRouter.tsx** ✅
**Location:** `/src/components/Simulation/SimulationRouter.tsx`

**Purpose:** Handles subdomain detection and authentication routing

**Features:**
- Detects `simulation.haccare.app` in production
- Detects `?simulation` param in development
- Routes unauthenticated users to SimulationLogin
- Routes authenticated users to SimulationPortal

### 3. **Service Functions** ✅
**Location:** `/src/services/simulationService.ts`

**New Function Added:**
```typescript
getUserSimulationAssignments(userId: string): Promise<SimulationAssignment[]>
```

**What it does:**
- Queries `simulation_participants` joined with `simulation_active`
- Filters for active simulations only
- Returns full simulation details + user's role
- Ordered by most recent first

## Routes Added

### App.tsx Updates
```typescript
<Route path="/simulation-portal" element={
  <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
    <SimulationPortal />
  </Suspense>
} />
```

2. Login with credentials
3. **See:** Loading screen with simulation name
4. **Action:** Auto-redirected to simulation after 1.5s
5. **Result:** Directly in simulation workspace

#### Scenario 2: Multiple Active Simulations
1. Navigate to `simulation.haccare.app`
2. Login with credentials
3. **See:** Grid of assigned simulations with details
4. **Action:** Click "Enter Simulation" on desired one
5. **Result:** Enters chosen simulation workspace

1. Navigate to `simulation.haccare.app`
2. Login with credentials
3. **See:** Friendly "No Active Simulations" message
4. **Content:** Instructions to contact instructor
5. **Result:** Clear guidance on next steps

### Instructor Experience

#### Main Flow
1. Navigate to `simulation.haccare.app`
2. Login with credentials
3. **See:** Dashboard with:
   - List of all active simulations they're teaching
   - "Launch New Simulation" button (blue)
   - "Manage All Simulations" button (gray)
   - Each simulation card shows status, role, participants, start date
4. **Options:**
   - Click simulation card → Enter that simulation
   - Click "Launch New" → Open SimulationManager to create new
   - Click "Manage" → Go to full simulation management page

## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries

#### Get User Assignments
```sql
SELECT 
  sp.id,
  sp.simulation_id,
  sp.role,
  sp.granted_at,
  sa.id,
  sa.name,
  sa.description,
  sa.status,
  sa.started_at,
  sa.tenant_id
FROM simulation_participants sp
INNER JOIN simulation_active sa ON sp.simulation_id = sa.id
WHERE sp.user_id = $1
  AND sa.status = 'active'
ORDER BY sp.granted_at DESC;
```

### Security (RLS)

#### Students
- Can only see their own assignments
- Can only access simulations they're assigned to
- Cannot create/delete simulations
- Can update their own `last_accessed_at`

#### Instructors
- See all simulations they're teaching
- Can create new simulations
- Can add/remove participants
- Can update simulation status
- Can view all participants

#### Admins
- Full access to all simulations
- Can delete simulations
- Can override any restrictions

## Configuration Files

### netlify.toml (Recommended Addition)
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "https://simulation.haccare.app/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  force = false
```

### DNS Record (Add to your provider)
```
Type: CNAME
Name: simulation
Value: haccare.app
TTL: 3600
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps

#### Test 1: Single Assignment Auto-Redirect
- [ ] Create simulation with one student assigned
- [ ] Login as that student at simulation.haccare.app
- [ ] Verify loading screen appears with simulation name
- [ ] Verify auto-redirect to simulation after 1.5s
- [ ] Verify simulation loads correctly

#### Test 2: Multiple Assignments Selection
- [ ] Assign student to 2+ active simulations
- [ ] Login as that student
- [ ] Verify selection screen shows all simulations
- [ ] Verify each card shows correct details
- [ ] Click one → Verify it loads that simulation

#### Test 3: No Assignments Message
- [ ] Create student with no simulation assignments
- [ ] Login as that student
- [ ] Verify "No Active Simulations" message
- [ ] Verify instructions are clear and helpful

#### Test 4: Instructor Dashboard
- [ ] Login as instructor/admin
- [ ] Verify dashboard shows quick action buttons
- [ ] Verify active simulations list appears
- [ ] Click "Launch New" → Verify goes to SimulationManager
- [ ] Click simulation card → Verify enters that simulation

#### Test 5: RLS Security
- [ ] Student A assigned to Sim 1
- [ ] Student B assigned to Sim 2
- [ ] Login as Student A → Should only see Sim 1
- [ ] Login as Student B → Should only see Sim 2
- [ ] Login as Instructor → Should see both

### Automated Testing (Future)

```typescript
describe('SimulationPortal', () => {
  test('auto-redirects for single assignment', async () => {
    // Mock single assignment
    // Render portal
    // Wait 1.5s
    // Assert navigation occurred
  });

  test('shows selection for multiple assignments', () => {
    // Mock multiple assignments
    // Render portal
    // Assert selection screen visible
  });

  test('shows message for no assignments', () => {
    // Mock empty assignments
    // Render portal
    // Assert message visible
  });
});
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Apply RLS Policies
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
docs/development/simulation-v2/setup_simulation_portal_rls.sql
```

### 2. Configure DNS
- Add CNAME record: `simulation.haccare.app` → `haccare.app`
- Wait for DNS propagation (24-48 hours)

### 3. Update Netlify
- Add domain alias in Netlify dashboard
- Or update netlify.toml with redirect rules
- Verify SSL certificate is issued

### 4. Test in Production
```bash
# Test DNS
nslookup simulation.haccare.app

# Test HTTPS
curl -I https://simulation.haccare.app

# Test in browser
# 1. Navigate to simulation.haccare.app
# 2. Login
# 3. Verify portal loads
```

### 5. Monitor
- Check Supabase logs for RLS violations
- Check browser console for errors
- Monitor user feedback

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- ✅ Students see only assigned simulations
- ✅ Auto-redirect works for single assignment
- ✅ Selection screen works for multiple assignments
- ✅ Clear messaging for unassigned users
- ✅ Instructors have quick access to management

### Technical

3. **Mobile App** - Native mobile experience for simulation portal
4. **Push Notifications** - Alert users when simulation starts

### Phase 3
1. **Live Presence** - Show who's currently in the simulation
2. **Session Recording** - Record simulation sessions for review
3. **Performance Metrics** - Track student engagement and actions
4. **Gamification** - Points, badges, leaderboards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "No simulations found" but user is assigned
- **Check:** `simulation_active.status = 'active'`
- **Check:** `simulation_participants.user_id` matches logged-in user
- **Fix:** Update simulation status or re-assign user

**Issue:** Auto-redirect doesn't work
- **Check:** Browser console for navigation errors
- **Check:** `simulation_id` is valid UUID
- **Fix:** Verify simulation exists and is active

**Issue:** RLS blocking legitimate access
- **Check:** Supabase logs for RLS violations
- **Check:** User's role in `user_profiles`
- **Fix:** Update RLS policies or user role

**Issue:** Subdomain not detected
- **Check:** `window.location.hostname` in console
- **Check:** DNS CNAME record
- **Fix:** Verify DNS propagation, check subdomain detection logic
