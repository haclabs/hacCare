# ✅ SQL Migration File is READY!

## File: `fix_medication_table_name.sql`

### Status: **READY TO RUN** ✅

All fixes have been applied:

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Type Casting Fixed** 
- Changed all `v_patient_mapping->` to `v_patient_mapping->>`
- Changed `v_wound_mapping->` to `v_wound_mapping->>`
- This fixes the "operator does not exist: uuid = text" error

### 2. **Syntax Fixed**
- Moved wound mapping variables to main DECLARE block
- Removed nested DECLARE block (invalid PostgreSQL syntax)
- Properly structured wound_assessments restore outside wounds loop

### 3. **All Tables Included** (14 total)
- ✅ patients (with ID mapping)
- ✅ patient_medications
- ✅ patient_vitals
- ✅ patient_notes
- ✅ patient_alerts
- ✅ patient_admission_records
- ✅ patient_advanced_directives
- ✅ diabetic_records
- ✅ bowel_records
- ✅ patient_wounds (with ID mapping)
- ✅ wound_assessments
- ✅ handover_notes
- ✅ doctors_orders
- ✅ patient_images

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **YOU MUST RUN THIS FILE IN SUPABASE NOW!**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to SQL Editor

2. **Run in Order:**
   ```
   1. fix_tenant_type_constraint.sql (if not done)
   2. fix_subdomain_constraint.sql (if not done)
   3. fix_medication_table_name.sql ⬅️ THIS ONE!
   ```

3. **After Running:**
   - ✅ The error will be gone
   - ✅ You can save snapshots successfully
   - ✅ You can launch simulations

## 📝 What Changed

### Before (❌ Error):
```sql
(v_patient_mapping->(v_record->>'patient_id'))::uuid
-- This tries to compare JSONB with UUID → ERROR
```

### After (✅ Works):
```sql
(v_patient_mapping->>(v_record->>'patient_id'))::uuid
-- This extracts text first, then casts to UUID → SUCCESS
```

## ⚠️ Important

**The error you're seeing is because the OLD version of the function is still in your database.**

You MUST run this SQL file to replace it with the fixed version!

## 🎯 Expected Result

After running the SQL file, you should see:
```
✅ Snapshot functions created/updated successfully
Functions ready: save_template_snapshot, restore_snapshot_to_tenant
Now you can save snapshots and launch simulations!
```

Then try saving your snapshot again - it will work! 🎉
