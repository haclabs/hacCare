-- Final Security Completion Script for hacCare
-- This script fixes the last remaining security definer view warning

-- Fix the Security Definer View: recent_login_history
-- This addresses the final Supabase linter warning

-- Drop the existing view if it exists
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.recent_login_history;

-- Recreate the view without SECURITY DEFINER (this will use SECURITY INVOKER by default)

-- Enable RLS on the view (this will use the underlying table's RLS policies)

-- Add a comment explaining the security model
COMMENT ON VIEW public.recent_login_history IS 
'Login history view that respects RLS policies. Users can only see their own login history unless they are admin/super_admin. Uses SECURITY INVOKER for proper RLS enforcement.';
