# Database Health Check Removal

## Problem
After logging in with credentials, the application would hang on "üîç Testing database connection..." message. This was causing a significant delay (15 seconds timeout) before users could access the application.

## Root Cause
The `checkDatabaseHealth()` function was being called synchronously during authentication flow:
1. User logs in with email/password
2. AuthContext tries to fetch user profile
3. Before fetching profile, `checkDatabaseHealth()` is called
4. The health check has a 15-second timeout
5. If the database is slow or has issues, users wait the full timeout period

## Solution
Removed blocking database health checks from the critical authentication path:

### Changes Made

1. **Header.tsx** - Removed database status indicator
   - Removed "DB Connected" / "DB Disconnected" badge
   - Removed unused imports: `Database`, `AlertTriangle`, `WifiOff`
   - Removed `dbError` prop
   - Simplified header UI

2. **App.tsx** - Removed dbError prop from Header component
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   <Header 
     onAlertsClick={() => setShowAlerts(true)}
     onBarcodeScan={handleBarcodeScan}
     dbError={dbError?.message || null} 
   />
   
   // After:
   <Header 
     onAlertsClick={() => setShowAlerts(true)}
     onBarcodeScan={handleBarcodeScan}
   />
   ```

3. **AuthContext.tsx** - Removed blocking health check before profile fetch
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   const isHealthy = await checkDatabaseHealth();
   if (!isHealthy) {
     console.warn('üì± Database unavailable - cannot fetch user profile');
     setIsOffline(true);
     return;
   }
   
   // After:
   // Skip health check - it's blocking and causing hangs
   // If the database is down, the query will fail and we'll handle it
   ```

## Benefits

1. ‚úÖ **Faster Login** - No more 15-second wait during authentication
2. ‚úÖ **Cleaner UI** - Removed unnecessary database status indicator
3. ‚úÖ **Better UX** - Users get immediate feedback if database is actually down (via query errors)
4. ‚úÖ **Fail Fast** - Database errors surface naturally through query failures with proper error handling

## Technical Details

The `checkDatabaseHealth()` function is still available in `supabase.ts` for use in non-critical paths (like status pages, admin dashboards, etc.), but it's no longer blocking the authentication flow.

### Error Handling Strategy
Instead of pre-checking database health, we now rely on:
- Query-level timeouts (8 seconds with AbortController)
- Try-catch blocks around database operations
- Natural error surfacing through failed queries
- User-friendly error messages when operations fail

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Login with email/password completes quickly
- [x] No hanging on "Testing database connection..."
- [x] Header displays correctly without database status
- [x] Profile loads successfully after login
- [x] Navigation works properly after login
- [x] No console errors related to missing props
