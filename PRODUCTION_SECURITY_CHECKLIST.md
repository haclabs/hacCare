## ⚠️ Critical Pre-Launch Items

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Remove test credentials** from all test files
2. **Implement input sanitization** for all user inputs
3. **Configure rate limiting** for login attempts
4. **Set up security monitoring** for production environment
5. **Review and test all RLS policies** in Supabase
6. **Conduct security penetration testing**

### Environment Variables Checklist:
```bash
# Production Environment Variables (.env)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Supabase Security Configuration:
- Enable RLS on all tables
- Configure proper authentication settings
- Set up database backups
- Review and restrict API access
- Enable audit logging
