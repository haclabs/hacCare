## Netlify Subdomain Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: lethpoly.haccare.app loads to Netlify error page

## 🔍 Step 1: Check Netlify DNS Configuration

1. **Verify wildcard DNS is actually active:**
   - Log into your Netlify dashboard
   - Go to your haccare.app site settings
   - Check Domain Management > Custom domains
   - Confirm you see: `*.haccare.app` listed as a domain alias

2. **Check DNS propagation:**
   - Use DNS checker: https://www.whatsmydns.net/
   - Enter: `lethpoly.haccare.app`
   - Should point to your Netlify IP or CNAME

## 🔍 Step 2: Check Netlify Redirects/Rewrites

The issue might be that Netlify needs explicit rewrite rules for subdomains.

**Problem**: Netlify might not be serving your SPA for subdomain requests.

**Solution**: Add subdomain rewrite rules to handle SPA routing.

## 🔍 Step 3: Check Build and Deployment

**Possible Issues:**
1. The build output doesn't include proper routing for subdomains
2. Netlify configuration missing subdomain handling
3. The application isn't being served correctly for wildcard domains

## 🔍 Step 4: Common Netlify Errors

**404 Error**: Subdomain not configured properly
**500 Error**: Build or configuration issue
**403 Error**: Domain access restricted

## Next Steps:
1. Check what exact error you're seeing
2. Update Netlify configuration
3. Test with proper redirects
