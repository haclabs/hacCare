-- Check existing alerts for NSG25 tenant to understand duplicate prevention

-- 1. Show all current alerts for NSG25 patients

    pa.patient_name,

-- 2. Show recent alerts (last 24 hours) to see duplicate prevention in action

-- 3. Check if there are unacknowledged alerts that might be blocking new ones

-- 4. Show alerts created within the last hour (duplicate prevention window)
