# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The "checking session" infinite loop was caused by persistent session logic using `localStorage` which causes hydration mismatches in production.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified AuthContext
- Removed `authPersistence.ts` imports and calls
- Disabled all localStorage/sessionStorage access
- Simplified session initialization to basic Supabase auth flow
- Kept the same console messages for debugging

### 2. Added Netlify Configuration
- Created `public/_redirects` file for SPA routing
- File contains: `/* /index.html 200`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables in Netlify
Go to your Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables

Make sure these are set:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

⚠️ **Important**: Use `VITE_` prefix, not `REACT_APP_`

### 2. Supabase Auth Configuration
In your Supabase dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration:

**Site URL:**
```
https://your-app-name.netlify.app
```

**Redirect URLs:**
```
https://your-app-name.netlify.app/**
https://your-app-name.netlify.app/auth/callback
```

### 3. Deploy and Test
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Deploy to Netlify
3. Test the login page loads properly
4. Test that you can sign in

## What Should Work Now
- ✅ Page loads instead of infinite "checking session"
- ✅ Login form appears
- ✅ Users can sign in normally
- ✅ Session persists across page refreshes (via Supabase, not localStorage)

## Re-enabling Persistent Sessions Later
Once basic auth is working in production, we can:
1. Fix the hydration issues in `authPersistence.ts`
2. Add proper SSR-safe session persistence
3. Gradually re-enable the enhanced features

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Environment variables set in Netlify
- [ ] Supabase redirect URLs updated
- [ ] App deploys successfully
- [ ] Login page loads without infinite spinner
- [ ] Can sign in and access the app
- [ ] Sessions persist after page refresh
