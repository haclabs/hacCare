# üîê Production Deployment Security Guide

## Critical Security Implementation for Production

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to secure your hacCare system for production deployment, ensuring only super admins can access cross-tenant data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Alert System Security Vulnerability - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Users without tenant assignments were seeing ALL alerts from all tenants
**Fix**: Modified AlertContext.tsx to show empty array instead of all alerts for unassigned users
**Location**: `/src/contexts/AlertContext.tsx` line 129-132

### 2. User Creation & Email Confirmation - READY ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Admin-created users couldn't login due to email confirmation requirement
**Fix**: Created functions for super admins to create pre-confirmed users
**Location**: `/sql-patches/fixes/fix-admin-user-creation.sql`

## üöÄ Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Critical Security Scripts

**IMPORTANT**: Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor in the following order:

#### A. Production Security Tightening (CRITICAL)
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of:
-- /workspaces/hacCare/sql-patches/fixes/production-security-tightening.sql
```

This script:
- ‚úÖ Enforces strict tenant isolation on ALL tables
- ‚úÖ Creates secure alert views that respect tenant boundaries  
- ‚úÖ Implements user access verification functions
- ‚úÖ Blocks cross-tenant data leakage
- ‚úÖ Ensures only super admins can see cross-tenant data

#### B. Admin User Creation Functions
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of:
-- /workspaces/hacCare/sql-patches/fixes/fix-admin-user-creation.sql
```

This script:
- ‚úÖ Allows super admins to create confirmed users
- ‚úÖ Users can login immediately without email confirmation
- ‚úÖ Maintains security by restricting to super admin only

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

Set these environment variables for production:

```bash
# Production Environment Settings
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_STRICT_TENANT_ISOLATION=true

# Supabase Configuration (replace with your production values)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-production-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-production-service-role-key

# Security Settings
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING=false
VITE_SHOW_DEVELOPMENT_FEATURES=false
```

### Step 3: DNS Configuration for Multi-Tenant Subdomains

For your tenant subdomain routing (hospital1.domain.com, hospital2.domain.com):

#### DNS Records Required:
```
Type: A Record
Name: @ (root domain)
Value: Your server IP

Type: A Record  
Name: * (wildcard)
Value: Your server IP

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: yourdomain.com
```

#### SSL Certificate:
- Use a wildcard SSL certificate (*.yourdomain.com)
- Configure your web server (Nginx/Apache) to handle subdomain routing
- Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all subdomains

### Step 4: Verify Security Implementation

Run these verification queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

#### A. Test Tenant Isolation
```sql
-- This should return only tenants the current user has access to
SELECT * FROM secure_patient_alerts;

-- Verify user access function works
SELECT user_has_tenant_access() as has_access;
```

#### B. Test Alert Security
```sql
-- This should only show alerts from user's assigned tenants
-- (or all alerts if user is super admin)
SELECT * FROM get_secure_alerts();
```

#### C. Check User Assignments
```sql
-- Verify all non-super-admin users have tenant assignments
SELECT 
  up.email,
  up.role,
  CASE 
    WHEN up.role = 'super_admin' THEN 'Super Admin - No Tenant Required'
    WHEN tu.tenant_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Assigned to Tenant'
    ELSE '‚ùå NEEDS TENANT ASSIGNMENT'
  END as tenant_status
FROM user_profiles up
LEFT JOIN tenant_users tu ON up.id = tu.user_id AND tu.is_active = true
WHERE up.is_active = true
ORDER BY up.role, up.email;
```

### Step 5: User Management for Production

#### Creating New Users (Super Admin Only):
```sql
-- Use this function to create confirmed users who can login immediately
SELECT create_confirmed_user(
  'newuser@hospital.com',
  'secure_password_123',
  'John',
  'Doe',
  'nurse'
);
```

#### Assigning Users to Tenants:
```sql
-- Assign user to tenant with specific role
SELECT assign_user_to_tenant(
  'user-uuid-here',
  'tenant-uuid-here', 
  'nurse'
);
```

## üîí Security Verification Checklist

Before going live, verify:

- [ ] **Alert System**: Users without tenants see empty alerts (not all alerts)
- [ ] **Patient Data**: Users can only see patients from their assigned tenants
- [ ] **Tenant Isolation**: All database queries respect tenant boundaries
- [ ] **Super Admin Access**: Only designated super admin can see cross-tenant data
- [ ] **User Creation**: Admin-created users can login immediately
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Production settings are configured
- [ ] **DNS & SSL**: Subdomain routing works with HTTPS
- [ ] **Database Policies**: All RLS policies are active and enforced

## üö® Security Warnings

### NEVER Do in Production:
1. ‚ùå Don't show all alerts to users without tenants
2. ‚ùå Don't disable tenant filtering for "convenience" 
3. ‚ùå Don't use development fallbacks in production
4. ‚ùå Don't allow unassigned users to access any patient data

### Always Ensure:
1. ‚úÖ Every non-super-admin user has a tenant assignment
2. ‚úÖ All queries include tenant filtering
3. ‚úÖ RLS policies are enabled on all tables
4. ‚úÖ Super admin access is restricted to designated accounts only

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Users can't login after admin creation**
- Solution: Run the `confirm_user_email()` function for the user

**Users see "no data" after login**
- Solution: Ensure user is assigned to a tenant using `assign_user_to_tenant()`

**Cross-tenant data visible**
- Solution: Verify RLS policies are enabled and run security tightening script

### Emergency Contact:
If you discover any security issues in production, immediately:
1. Check the security logs in Supabase Dashboard
2. Run the verification queries above
3. Ensure all users are properly assigned to tenants

## üéØ Final Production Readiness Confirmation

Once all steps are complete, your system will have:
- ‚úÖ Strict tenant isolation enforced at database level
- ‚úÖ Secure alert system with no cross-tenant leakage
- ‚úÖ Streamlined user creation for administrators
- ‚úÖ Proper subdomain routing for multi-tenant access
- ‚úÖ Production-ready security configuration

**Your hacCare system is now secure for production deployment! üöÄ**
