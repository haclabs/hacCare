# Housekeeping - Organizing SQL Fix Files

## Files Created During This Session

The following SQL fix files were created during our troubleshooting session:

### 🎯 **ACTIVE/WORKING FIXES** (Keep these)
1. **immediate-recursion-fix.sql** - The main fix that resolved the infinite recursion
2. **fix-tenant-assignment-function-v2.sql** - The working tenant assignment function

### 🗂️ **EXPERIMENTAL/SUPERSEDED FIXES** (Can be moved to archive)
1. **secure-recursion-fix-final.sql** - Initial secure fix attempt (superseded)
2. **secure-recursion-fix-dependencies.sql** - Dependency handling version (superseded)
3. **fix-tenant-assignment-function.sql** - First attempt with parameter conflicts (superseded)
4. **run-sql-fix.mjs** - Node.js script attempt (not used)

## Recommended Cleanup Actions

### 1. Move working fixes to proper location:
```bash
mv immediate-recursion-fix.sql sql-patches/fixes/
mv fix-tenant-assignment-function-v2.sql sql-patches/fixes/
```

### 2. Archive experimental files:
```bash
mkdir -p archive/sql-session-fixes/
mv secure-recursion-fix-*.sql archive/sql-session-fixes/
mv fix-tenant-assignment-function.sql archive/sql-session-fixes/
mv run-sql-fix.mjs archive/sql-session-fixes/
```

### 3. Clean up root directory:
The root directory should only contain:
- Configuration files (package.json, vite.config.ts, etc.)
- Documentation files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)
- Source code directories (src/, sql-patches/, etc.)
