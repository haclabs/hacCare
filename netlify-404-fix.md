# Netlify 404 Fix for Subdomains

## The Issue
Getting a 404 error (not even loading the app) means Netlify's server isn't serving your application for subdomains.

## Root Cause
Even though DNS is working and Netlify says it manages subdomains, there might be a specific configuration missing.

## Solution: Add Explicit Subdomain Redirect Rules

The current netlify.toml has generic redirects, but we need explicit subdomain handling.
