/**
 * Doctors Orders Alert System - Features Summary
 * =============================================
 * 
 * This system adds visual alerts for new doctors orders to improve clinical workflow.
 * 
 * NEW FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
 * 
 * 1. PATIENT OVERVIEW CARD ALERT:
 *    - Shows "New Order" badge on Doctors Orders card when unacknowledged orders exist
 *    - Badge disappears when all orders are acknowledged
 *    - Real-time updates when orders are acknowledged/created
 * 
 * 2. INDIVIDUAL ORDER ALERTS:
 *    - NEW badge: Red with pulsing animation for unacknowledged orders
 *    - ACKNOWLEDGED badge: Green with checkmark for acknowledged orders
 *    - Clear visual distinction between order states
 * 
 * 3. REAL-TIME UPDATES:
 *    - Badge count updates immediately when orders are:
 *      * Created (adds to count)
 *      * Acknowledged (removes from count)
 *    - No page refresh needed
 * 
 * WORKFLOW:
 * 1. Doctor creates new order → "New Order" badge appears on overview card
 * 2. Individual order shows red "NEW" badge with pulse animation
 * 3. Nurse clicks acknowledge → order shows green "ACKNOWLEDGED" badge
 * 4. Overview card badge updates/disappears when all orders acknowledged
 * 
 * VISUAL DESIGN:
 * - New Order Card Badge: Bright color to catch attention
