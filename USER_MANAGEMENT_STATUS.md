# User Management Issue Resolution Summary

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- UserForm useAuth import error 
- Tenant assignment feature for super admins implemented
- RLS policy infinite recursion resolved with helper view
- Data type mismatches fixed (JSONB → TEXT[])
- Created safe RPC functions for tenant queries

❌ **Remaining Issues:**
- Users cannot be deleted due to Auth API limitations
- Role constraint violations when assigning existing users to tenants
- Super admin users incorrectly placed in tenant_users table

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **User Deletion Issue**: Supabase Auth API requires service role key to delete users, which frontend doesn't have access to
2. **Role Constraint Violation**: The `tenant_users` table only allows roles `('admin', 'doctor', 'nurse', 'viewer')` but some users have other roles like `'super_admin'`
3. **Architecture Issue**: Super admin users should NOT be in the `tenant_users` table - they manage globally across all tenants

## Solution Approach

### 1. Soft Delete Instead of Hard Delete
- Replace user deletion with user deactivation
- Set `is_active = false` in both `user_profiles` and `tenant_users` tables
- Filter out inactive users in the UI

### 2. Fix Role Constraint Issues
- Remove super admin users from `tenant_users` table (they shouldn't be there)
- Fix any users with invalid roles
- Clean up orphaned user assignments

### 3. Database Functions Created
- `deactivate_user(UUID)` - Soft delete users (super admin only)
- `permanently_delete_user(UUID)` - Hard delete from database tables (super admin only)
- `cleanup_orphaned_users()` - Find users without tenant assignments
- `fix_user_role_mismatches()` - Fix role constraint violations

## Files Updated

### Frontend Changes
- ✅ `src/components/Users/UserManagement.tsx` - Changed to use deactivation instead of deletion
- ✅ `src/components/Users/UserForm.tsx` - Added tenant assignment for super admins

### Database Scripts
- ✅ `fix-user-deletion-and-roles-updated.sql` - Complete solution for user management issues

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Apply Database Fixes
Run the SQL script `fix-user-deletion-and-roles-updated.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- This script will:
-- - Fix role constraints on tenant_users table
-- - Create deactivation functions
-- - Remove super admins from tenant_users table
-- - Clean up orphaned users
-- - Show current issues that need attention
```

### 2. Test the Solution
After applying the SQL script:
1. Try the "Delete" button in User Management (now deactivates users)
2. Test tenant assignment for existing users
3. Verify super admins can manage all tenants without constraint errors

### 3. Verify Results
The script will show:
- Users that were removed from tenant_users table
- Any role mismatches that were fixed
- Orphaned users that need attention

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema Clarification
- `user_profiles` table: Contains all users with global roles
- `tenant_users` table: Contains tenant-specific role assignments (NOT for super admins)
- Super admins manage globally and should not have entries in `tenant_users`

### Error Messages You Were Seeing
- "User not allowed" - Supabase Auth API limitation requiring service role
- Role constraint violations - Super admins in tenant_users table where they shouldn't be

### UI Changes Made
- Delete button now shows "deactivate" and uses soft delete
- Only active users are shown in the user list
- Tenant assignment works without constraint violations

## Expected Outcome

After applying the fixes:
1. ✅ User "deletion" will work (via deactivation)
2. ✅ Tenant assignment will work for all valid user roles
3. ✅ Super admins will manage globally without constraint errors
4. ✅ No more infinite recursion in RLS policies
5. ✅ Clean separation between global and tenant-specific user management

The system will have proper multi-tenant user management with soft deletion and appropriate role constraints.
