# 🧹 Cleanup Tools & AI Documentation

This directory contains powerful tools for maintaining and understanding the hacCare codebase.

## 📁 Tools Overview

### 1. 🤖 AI Documentation Generator
**File**: `create-ai-guide.js`  
**Purpose**: Creates comprehensive AI-readable documentation explaining exactly how the hacCare system works.

**Features**:
- Complete architecture overview
- All file paths and their purposes  
- Component relationships and data flow
- Development patterns and best practices
- Security and multi-tenancy details
- Testing and deployment information

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/cleanup/create-ai-guide.js
```

**Output**: `AI-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md` - A 700+ line comprehensive guide

### 2. 🔍 Unused File Analyzer  
**File**: `analyze-unused-files.js`  
**Purpose**: Identifies potentially unused files in the codebase.

**Features**:
- Scans all source files for imports/exports
- Identifies files not referenced by others
- Finds duplicate file names (potential redundancy)
- Categorizes files by type (components, tests, utilities)
- Provides cleanup recommendations

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/cleanup/analyze-unused-files.js
```

### 3. 🛡️ Safe Cleanup Tool
**File**: `safe-cleanup.js`  
**Purpose**: Safely removes unused files with automatic backups.

**Features**:
- **Always creates backups** before deletion
- **Archive mode** for questionable files (safer than deletion)
- **Interactive cleanup** with recommendations
- **Restore capability** to undo changes
- **Cleanup logging** for audit trail

**Usage**:
```bash
# Interactive cleanup (recommended)
node scripts/cleanup/safe-cleanup.js

# Show help
node scripts/cleanup/safe-cleanup.js --help

# Show restore instructions  
node scripts/cleanup/safe-cleanup.js --restore
```

## 🎯 What Was Cleaned Up

### ✅ Files Safely Removed:
- `src/utils/sanitization.ts.backup` - Old backup file
- `debug-tenant-counts.js` - Temporary debug script

### 📦 Files Archived (moved to `/archive`):
- `smart-demo.js` - Demo file, likely outdated
- `test-dompurify.mjs` - Test file, no longer needed  
- `smart-sanitization-demo.mjs` - Demo superseded by newer implementation
- `test-sanitization-fix.js` - Temporary fix validation

### 🔒 Safety Features:
- All files backed up to `/cleanup-backup` before removal
- Archived files moved to `/archive` instead of deletion
- Detailed cleanup log in `cleanup-backup/cleanup-log.json`
- Easy restore process if needed

- **Cleaned**: 6 unused/demo files
- **Archived**: 4 questionable files (safely recoverable)
- **Deleted**: 2 clearly unused files (with backups)

## 🔄 Maintenance

Re-run these tools periodically:

```bash
# Update AI documentation after major changes
node scripts/cleanup/create-ai-guide.js

# Check for new unused files monthly
node scripts/cleanup/analyze-unused-files.js

# Clean up accumulating test/demo files quarterly  
node scripts/cleanup/safe-cleanup.js
```

## 🆘 Recovery

If you need to restore files:

1. **Check backups**: All deleted files are in `cleanup-backup/`
2. **Check archive**: Archived files are in `archive/` 
3. **Review log**: See `cleanup-backup/cleanup-log.json` for details
4. **Restore manually**: Copy files back to original locations
