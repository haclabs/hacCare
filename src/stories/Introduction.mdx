# hacCare Component Library

Welcome to the hacCare Hospital Patient Record System component library. This Storybook instance serves as both documentation and a development environment for our UI components.

## Component Categories

Our components are organized into the following categories:

- **UI**: Basic UI elements like buttons, inputs, and loading indicators
- **Layout**: Structural components like Header, Sidebar, and layout containers
- **Patients**: Components related to patient management and display
- **Auth**: Authentication-related components
- **Alerts**: Notification and alert components

## Development Guidelines

When creating or modifying components:

1. **Consistency**: Follow the established design patterns and naming conventions
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure components are accessible to all users
3. **Responsiveness**: Components should work well on all screen sizes
4. **Documentation**: Add proper documentation and examples in Storybook

## Using This Storybook

- Browse components in the sidebar
- Interact with component props using the "Controls" panel
- View component documentation in the "Docs" tab
- Examine component code in the "Story" tab

Happy coding!
