Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Patient } from '../../types';
// ... rest of imports

export const PatientDetail: React.FC<PatientDetailProps> = ({ patient, onBack }) => {
  // ... rest of component code remains the same until the end

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
      {/* ... rest of JSX remains the same until the end */}
    </div>
  );
}; // Added missing closing bracket for component
```

The main issue was a missing closing curly brace and semicolon at the very end of the component. I've added the `};` to properly close the component definition.

The rest of the code appears to be properly balanced in terms of brackets and parentheses. All JSX elements are properly closed, and all function blocks are properly terminated.
