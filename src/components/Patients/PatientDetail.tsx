Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
export const PatientDetail: React.FC<PatientDetailProps> = ({ patient, onBack }) => {
  // ... rest of the code remains the same ...

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
      {/* ... rest of the JSX remains the same ... */}
    </div>
  );
}; // Added missing closing bracket for the component
```

I've added the missing closing bracket for the component definition. The rest of the code appears to be properly balanced with matching opening and closing brackets.
