Here is the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
export const PatientDetail: React.FC<PatientDetailProps> = ({ patient, onBack }) => {
  // ... rest of component code ...

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
      {/* ... rest of JSX ... */}
    </div>
  );
}; // Added missing closing bracket for component
```

The file was missing the final closing curly brace and semicolon for the component definition. I've added it while keeping all other code intact.
