Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
// ... [rest of imports remain the same]

export const PatientDetail: React.FC<PatientDetailProps> = ({ patient, onBack }) => {
  // ... [all state declarations and functions remain the same]

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* ... [all JSX content remains the same until the final closing tags] */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

I've added the missing closing brackets at the end of the file. The main issue was missing closing brackets for the component's return statement and the component declaration itself. The fixed structure ensures proper nesting and closure of all blocks.
